# Ear Training App

_This is still very much a work in progress -- there are still a lot of features to be added._

I created this as a passion project to learn web development. This is a web application (with plans in the far future to bring to mobile platforms) for ear training based upon the 2022 Piano Syllabus of the Royal Conservatory, with the ability to customize exercises. By providing the opportunity to practice interval, chord, and chord progression recognition, as well as clapback/playback (rhythm and melody recognition), this application allows piano and music students to train their aural skills by themselves, without the need for a teacher. All progress made is saved to your account and displayed to allow students to track their improvement over time.

### Features:
* Login with email
* Four exercises: intervals, chords, chord progression, clapback/playback.
* Follows the Royal Conservatory of Music's syllabus for piano, from grade 1 to grade 10, with additional ability to create custom exercises.
* Ability to track progress over time.
* Simple and minimalistic user experience.

### Built with:
* _Vexflow_: an open-source online music notation rendering API.
* _Tone.js_: a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser.
* _Next.js_: a React framework for building full-stack web applications.
* _PostgreSQL_: a powerful, open source object-relational database system.
* _Prisma ORM_: a next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM that unlocks a new level of developer experience when working with databases thanks to its intuitive data model, automated migrations, type-safety & auto-completion.
* _Tailwind_: a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
