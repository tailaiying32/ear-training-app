# Ear Training App

_This is still very much a work in progress -- there are still a lot of features to be added._

This is a web application developed for ear training based upon the 2022 Piano Syllabus of the Royal Conservatory, with the ability to customize exercises. By providing the opportunity to practice interval, chord, and chord progression recognition, as well as clapback/playback (rhythm and melody recognition), this application allows piano and music students to train their aural skills by themselves, without the need for a teacher. All progress made is saved to your account and displayed to allow students to track their improvement over time.
